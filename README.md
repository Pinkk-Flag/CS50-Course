# CS50-Course

Welcome! This is my notes as well as the files that I have created from doing the CS50 course. As of writing, I am up to Week 1 - C, but I will try and gradually update it and finish it by the Summer Holiday (Summer in Australia). You can feel free to use any of the code to see my thought process or just leaf over my notes to get a glimpse of CS50. 

## Would I recommend?
110%. It is a great course for anyone wanting to get a good introduction into computer science and has definately enhanced the way I view computer science as a whole. A big part of that is the atmosphere. It offers a very learning intensive yet laid back approach that I love. I would honestly recommend doing it online (via the link here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) because it is like going at your own pace, and you can really pause and internalise in the information at hand. Another big player into why this is one of my favourite courses is the professor, David Melan. He teaches in such as calm, and understandable way that somehow just works! The challenges, and well built software alongside the content are a perfect combinaiton for learning. Not only that, but it's free, which I think is such as kind thing to do and really showcases that learning can be done by practically anyone, you just gotta grab it. Anyways, enough of me rambling, you should try the course out (at least do 2 weeks before you feel like quitting!).
